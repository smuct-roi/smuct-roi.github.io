summary: Talk by [Jimin Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimin-huang-239abb261/)
abstract: "As financial reporting grows in scale and complexity, the auditing domain demands AI systems capable of structured reasoning, taxonomy alignment, and cross-document consistency. This talk presents a comprehensive effort toward AI readiness in auditing through new benchmarks and domain-specific models. I introduce FinTagging, an LLM-oriented benchmark for end-to-end XBRL tagging that evaluates numerical entity extraction (FinNI) and fine-grained US-GAAP concept linking (FinCL). I then present FinAuditing, the first benchmark built from real XBRL filings to assess semantic matching, hierarchical relationship detection, and multi-step numerical reasoning across structured multi-document data. Zero-shot evaluation of 13 LLMs reveals persistent challenges in schema-aware reasoning and consistency checking. Finally, I introduce AuditWen, an open-source audit-focused LLM trained on a 30K-sample instruction dataset spanning entity recognition, legal reasoning, and audit report generation. Together, these contributions provide the first unified ecosystem for advancing trustworthy AI in auditing."
