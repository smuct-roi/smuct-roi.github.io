summary: Talk by Cardiff NLP members
abstract: "We will discuss the EMNLP 2025 highlights (including workshops and other recent NLP/ML venues). We'll create a shared document that we can edit during the session. Please feel free to share your thoughts on any papers you found interesting, as well as any impressions on trends, papers related to your research area, or award-winning papers. It will be informal, and the aim is simply for us to catch up on recent research and share insights with the group. The proceedings are available [here](https://aclanthology.org/events/emnlp-2025/). No preparation is needed!"
